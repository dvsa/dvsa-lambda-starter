# lambda-starter
A starting pattern for AWS lambda in Typescript 

**Requirements**
- node v12.18.3
- [SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)

**Build**
- `npm i`
- `npm run build:dev`

**Run Lambdas Locally**
- `npm run start:dev`
- To ensure that the lambdas have been successfully served, run the following command in a separate terminal:
    - `curl --request GET http://localhost:3000/?message=hello%20world`
    - response should be: `{"pathParams": {"message": "hello world"}}`

**Debug Lambdas Locally (VS Code only)**
- Run lambdas in debug mode: `npm run start:dev -- -d 5858`
- Add a breakpoint to the lambda being tested (`src/handler/index.ts`)
- Run the debug config from VS Code that corresponds to lambda being tested (`IndexLambdaFunction`)
- Send an HTTP request to the lambda's URI (`curl --request GET http://localhost:3000/?message=hello%20world`)


**Tests**
- The [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) framework is used to run tests and collect code coverage
- To run the tests, run the following command within the root directory of the project: `npm test`
- Coverage results will be displayed on terminal and stored in the `coverage` directory
    - The coverage requirements can be set in `jest.config.js`


**Logging**

By using a utility wrapper (`src/utility/logger`) surrounding `console.log`, the`awsRequestId` and a "correlation ID" is output with every debug/info/warn/error message.

For this pattern to work, every service/lambda must forward their correlation ID to subsequent services via a header e.g. `X-Correlation-Id`. 

In practice, the first lambda invoked by an initial request will not have received the `X-Correlation-Id` header, so its `correlationId` gets defaulted to its `lambdaRequestId`.
This `correlationId` should then be used when invoking subsequent lambdas via the `X-Correlation-Id` header.
Every lambda called subsequently will then check for that `X-Correlation-Id` header and inject it into their logs.

This shows an example of what the log looks like from the first invoked lambda:
```

```
This shows an example of what the logs look like from the second invoked lambda (called via the first lambda):
```
2020-09-10T17:05:31.627Z	32ff455b-057d-1dd7-98b8-7034bf182dc8	INFO	{"apiRequestId":"d9222e0a-6bd9-49e0-84dd-ffe0680bd141","correlationId":"5ff37fce-5ace-114c-9120-a1406cc8d11d","message":"Here's a gnarly info message from lambda 2 - notice how my correlationId is the same as the lambda 1"}
